# URL Structure Fix for automaticpetfeeder.redwancodes.com

## What Has Been Changed

1. Added a `.htaccess` file in the root directory that:
   - Redirects visitors from `/public/...` URLs to clean URLs without the "public" segment
   - Internally handles routing requests to the correct files in the public directory
   - Ensures all URLs are clean and user-friendly

2. Updated the root `index.html` file to:
   - Remove the meta refresh redirect to public/index.html
   - Provide a simple loading screen while the .htaccess rules take effect
   - Include a fallback JavaScript redirect if needed

## Implementation Steps for Your Hosting

1. Upload both the root `.htaccess` file and the updated `index.html` to your server's root directory (where your `public` folder is located)

2. Make sure mod_rewrite is enabled on your server (it typically is on cPanel hosting)

3. Verify that the website now works with clean URLs:
   - https://automaticpetfeeder.redwancodes.com/ should load the main page
   - https://automaticpetfeeder.redwancodes.com/login.html should load the login page
   - The URL should no longer show "public" in the path

## Troubleshooting

If the clean URLs don't work:

1. Check if `.htaccess` files are allowed on your hosting (they usually are in cPanel)
2. Verify that `mod_rewrite` is enabled
3. You might need to add these lines to your `.htaccess` file if you get "Internal Server Error":
   ```
   Options +FollowSymLinks
   RewriteOptions Inherit
   ```

4. If the hosting provider has special requirements, you might need to adjust the paths in the `.htaccess` file.
   
## Note About Asset Links

If you encounter any broken images or resources, check if any absolute paths in your HTML files include `/public/`. Those should be updated to remove the "public" segment.
